Located north of the Malebo \\nPool of the lower Congo River, the Kingdom profited from fertile soils, abundant rainfall, and the presence \\nof valuable iron and copper deposits. Beginning in \\nthe late 1300s, the Bakongo people living south of \\nthe Congo River unified into a single kingdom with a \\ncapital at Mbanza Kongo, from which the Manikongo \\n(king of the Kingdom of Kongo) ruled. When the \\nPortuguese arrived in 1483, the Manikongos of Kongo \\nsaw an immediate material advantage in establishing \\ndiplomatic and trade relations with the new arrivals. In \\nthe short term, participation in the Atlantic trade gave \\nKongo a competitive edge over Kongo’s landlocked \\nneighbors such as the Tyo. \\nArtist: Jeff Israel \\xa0\\xa0\\nSource: Wikimedia Commons \\xa0\\nLicense: CC BY-SA 3.0  | © Jeff Israel African Empires 500BCE to 1500BCE\\xa0\\n\\n7Mangaaka Power Figure \\n(Nkisi N’Kondi) \\nArtist: Kongo artist and nganga, Yombe group\\nSource: The Metropolitan Museum of Art\\nLicense: Public Domain\\nThe religion of the Portuguese (Catholic Christianity) \\nappealed to the kings of Kongo, who hoped that \\nconversion to the new faith would give them the same \\npower which Portuguese rulers held over their subjects. \\nAfter all, Catholic Christianity justified the rule of \\nkings over their subjects, helping to legitimize and \\ncentralize the power of such monarchs. Furthermore, \\nCatholicism was readily compatible with traditional \\nKongo spiritual beliefs. For instance, the Creator God \\nof Christianity appeared similar to the Creator God of \\nancient Bantu belief. Catholic Christianity also had a \\ngroup of holy individuals, the saints, who had died and \\ngone to heaven and could be prayed to for help in this \\nlife. This concept again mirrored Kongolese beliefs in \\na sky God whose spirits could likewise be invoked to \\nintervene in the lives of mortals. \\nIn the early 1500s, the rulers of Kongo, particularly \\nAfonso I, grasped the advantages of literacy and \\nthe possibilities of literate education. They aimed to \\nstrengthen and build a more effective administrative \\napparatus that would provide better communications \\nboth with Europe and among their own provinces. By \\nthe mid-16th century, Kongo scribes were literate in Portuguese and Latin and, by the later 16th century, in \\nthe KiKongo language. \\nThe contact with the Portuguese provided a \\ncommercial basis and a new set of ideas supportive of \\nroyal legitimacy and authority, helping Kongo become \\nthe most powerful kingdom of the region. Cities \\narose at the critical points of political authority and \\ncommercial connections. Mbanza Kongo, already a city \\nin the 1480s, became a still larger city with more than \\n50,000 inhabitants. Provincial capitals developed into \\ngood-sized cities. Enslaved people, especially those \\ncaptured in war, helped build these expanding urban \\ncenters. Significant growth in upper-class wealth took \\nplace, intensifying social stratification. Such wealth \\nencouraged Kongo to become increasingly involved in \\nthe slave trade. In the 16th century, Kongo began to \\nexport nominally free people as well as slaves to the \\nAmericas, specifically to Brazil. \\nAlthough Kongo continued to be an independent \\npower through the 18th century, new factors began \\nundercutting its autonomy. In the 1570s, the Portuguese \\nset up a colony along the coast, opposite Luanda Island, \\nwhich dominated the production and supply of nzimbu \\nshells (used as currency). Portuguese merchants also \\nset up regular trade relations with local kingdoms \\nto the south, drawing them away from the sphere of \\nKongo influence. The Atlantic trade also began to \\nattract other European merchants to the coast by the \\nlate 1500s, most notably the Dutch. In the 1630s and \\nthe 1640s, Dutch traders offered new direct outlets \\nfor goods from the Lower Congo region. These new \\nroutes cut the Kongo kingdom off from lucrative trade \\nconnections in the interior. In 1665, Dutch forces and \\ntheir African allies defeated a Kongolese expedition \\nat the Battle of Mbwila. The kingdom then entered \\na period of civil war as powerful factions sought to \\ninstall their own candidates as king. Having lost most \\nof its power by the early 18th century, the Kingdom of \\nKongo existed largely in name only.'"],"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":8}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Data Splitting: set splitter and chunk size\n","- We originally used a smaller chunk_size and overlap, but we noticed the context information was not sufficiently preserved.
